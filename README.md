# Project Overview
Utilized python to determine factors that strongly predict life expectancy in the global context.

## Problem Statement'
The World Health Organization (WHO) has a sustainable development goal which aims “to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages” (WHO). To achieve this goal, they target the following indicators: maternal mortality, child mortality, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, substance abuse, road traffic, environmental health, sexual and reproductive health. Thus, evaluating how some of these indicators impact health and  life expectancy can aid in achieving WHO’s sustainable development goal. 

## Goals and Success Metrics
To identify features that strongly predict life expectancy and to draw a clear conclusion based on the results of the model
